This is the main LED controller application that is run on the AVR.
Essentially, it takes input from the RS-485 network and then converts it to a
stream of serial data for the TLC5940 serial inputs.


Serial format:
    [SYNC][ADDR][LED0RED][LED0GRN][LED0BLU][LED1RED][LED1GRN][LED1BLU]...[LED4RED][LED4GRN][LED4BLU]


Addressing:
    Each device should have a unique address from 0x00 to 0xEF.  0xF0-0xFF are
    reserved for awesomeness.

    Essentially (and this goes for the bootloader too), if you try to operate
    on 0xF0, it will actually operate on all devices from 0x00 through 0x0F.
    If you try to operate on 0xF1, it will actually affect 0x10 through 0x1F.
